The UC Libraries Digital Collection (UCLDC) is a technology stack for managing and providing access to unique digital content. This site contains policies and procedures for content owners. [Request an Account]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/docs/create-account/)

Unique Digital Content
==============================================================================

Data for all collections designated for public access - whether managed in the shared DAMS or in other platforms - is harvested by CDL and stored in the UCLDC common index. "Data" includes item-level metadata and references to access copies of files, stored by CDL for the optimal display of content in public access points, such as Calisphere. [Calisphere Contributor Policies]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/docs/registry/access-policies/) and Metadata Display Specs coming soon. 

Procedures to queue your collection for harvest are in the <a href="{{ site.url }}{{site.baseurl}}/docs/registry/index/">Calisphere Administration Guide</a> (coming soon).

Exposure to Public Access Points
===================
CDL exposes all the data in the common index to three public access points: 

- The common index API, which can be used to query and display the data in custom interfaces
- The new Calisphere website (beta version to be released in Summer 2015)
- The Digital Public Library of America (DPLA) website and platform

Nuxeo Digital Asset Management System (DAMS)
================

Contributors can provide a data feed for harvest from their own systems, or use the shared DAMS provided as part of the UCLDC stack. The Nuxeo DAMS is a tool for object-level metadata and associated content file management. Use the DAMS to build simple to complex objects - images, texts, audio, video, etc. - import or create metadata records, and import or upload content files.
