# Objects in the DAMS

The Nuxeo DAMS allows you to create objects of four different document types: Picture, File, Video, and Audio. For the purpose of this documentation, an object is a content file, its affiliated metadata record. Each of these document types contain the same metadata model and can contain sub-objects of any of the four different document types, but vary in the type of content file you can upload, and the derivatives of that content file that Nuxeo automatically creates. Most common filetypes are supported, see Nuxeo's documentation here for a complete list: [http://doc.nuxeo.com/display/public/USERDOC/Supported+File+Formats](http://doc.nuxeo.com/display/public/USERDOC/Supported+File+Formats). The metadata model follows Dublin Core standards, and includes Descriptive, Technical, and Rights Information. Unicode is supported in metadata. Each document type can contain sub-objects of any of the four document types. There is no limit on the number of child objects. Child objects are viewable and orderable via the Summary tab of their parent object.
