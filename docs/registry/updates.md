##rough notes

How do we update metadata for objects, within a collection that has been harvested?
Updates are handled through re-harvesting the collection.  For now, Collection Administrators can contact us to initiate a re-harvest. Eventually, Collection Administrators will be able to initiate this through the Registry.


How do we remove metadata for objects -- for example, to comply with a copyright-related takedown request?
Collection Administrators should contact us if a harvested item needs to be removed from the Common Index (and subsequently, removed from publication in Calisphere and DPLA).  We will remove metadata in a timely manner.


##potential call-out:
How often do you harvest?
Currently, Collections Administrators can contact us to initiate harvests on an on-request basis.  Eventually, Collection Administrations will be able to initiate this directly through the Registry.
