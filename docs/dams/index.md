#### What is the DAMS?
The DAMS is a tool for creating and managing object-level metadata and content files. You can use it to build out objects (such as images, texts, audio, and video), create metadata, and upload content files. Our shared DAMS for the UC Libraries is a customized implementation of [http://www.nuxeo.com/](Nuxeo), a platform that is used by a variety of organizations--from media companies to the U.S. Navy--for their content management needs.

#### Getting in
You need an account to access the shared DAMS. If you have an account already, use your Single Sign-On account to login at [https://nuxeo.cdlib.org/nuxeo/](https://nuxeo.cdlib.org/nuxeo/). If you do not already have an account, please [create an account]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/docs/create-account/).

#### Navigation
On login, you should see a screen that looks like this: 

<a class="img-popup" href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/1_on-login.png">
  <img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/1_on-login.png" alt="Screenshot after logging in" style="width: 500px">
</a>

The first thing you'll notice is that the DAMS is organized hierarchically. Here we are at the root of the hierarchy, looking at a list of its contents. From here, click on 'Asset Library' to navigate to the spaces where we will be creating and managing objects in the DAMS.

Now you should see a list of all 10 campuses and UCOP. These are campus folders, which are the spaces where we'll be getting to work. Navigate to the folder for your campus. You will then see a list of project folders, named for collections that we have pre-loaded into the DAMS. (We'll talk more about [project folders]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/docs/dams/organization/) in the next section.) Notice how the sidebar reflects where you are in the hierarchy. Feel free to explore the folders of your campus and those of the other campuses. 

### Key Elements of the DAMS interface:
Take a moment to familiarize yourself with the DAMS interface.

- Navigation Bar
  - Home: use this to return to the default landing page for the DAMS.
  - Document Management: this is the primary, functional area of the DAMS for creating and managing digital objects.
  - Quick & Advanced Search: See the [search]() section for further details. 
- Sidebar
  - Digital objects within the DAMS are hierarchically organized. By default, the sidebar displays this hierarchy.
- Breadcrumbs: Used to reveal where the object or folder you are currently viewing exists in the hierarchy.
- Current object or project folder & its tabs: These tabs change depending on the kind of object or folder you are viewing and will be discussed in subsequent sections for [project folders]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/docs/dams/organization/) and [objects]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/docs/dams/edit-objects/).
