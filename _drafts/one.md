Step 2: Log into the Collection Registry and explore
------------------

4. Go back to the Collection Registry administration URL, and log in using your Single Sign-On account: https://registry.cdlib.org/edit/
Now that your UCLDC account is activated, you will have administrative access rights to the Collection Registry.
5. The edit interface allows you to change selected information in the Collection Registry. Currently, you can add new collections, delete collections, edit collection names, and edit the source of collections (shared DAMS or harvest).
Note that all campus collections are editable, so please take care with your changes; we would recommend either correcting information for your own collections (if known), or creating a “dummy” collection to experiment with.
6. Once you've finished exploring the Collection Registry, please close out your browser to log out of the session.

Step 3: Log into the Nuxeo DAMS and explore
---------------

7. Login to the Nuxeo DAMS using your Single Sign-On account: https://nuxeo.cdlib.org/nuxeo/
8.  Once logged in, you'll see the default landing page. In the following views, please note that we haven’t fully customized what users will see on each screen.  Nuxeo supports a wide range of configuration options, and we’ll be refining the interface over subsequent releases.
9. Click on DAMS in the toolbar, to access this particular module within Nuxeo.  You'll now see objects that are specific to your library.  These objects, in turn, are organized within a Project Folder.  These are essentially workspaces for organizing objects in Nuxeo; see below for further details.  In this particular Project Folder, we’ve preloaded four simple example objects for the Aggie release, each reflecting a different file format (image, text, audio, and video). 
10. Feel free to view to explore the objects and the Nuxeo DAMS interface:
- Clicking on one of these objects will show you a view of sample metadata, and more detailed views of the object.  The metadata scheme that you see here is based on Nuxeo’s default configuration.  In subsequent releases, we will be extending these fields.
- You can also experiment with adding a new object, using the "New Asset" button; this will give you a sense of the out-of-the-box Nuxeo object import process.  Note that these objects may not be retained beyond this release. 
11. To explore the Project Folders:
- Click on Document Management
- In My Workspaces, select the folder icon for your UC campus library
- You will be presented with a list of existing Project Folders; the left-hand navigation indicates which Project Folders are listed under your UC campus library.  For this release, we've established a single Project Folder ("Aggie"), to organize the four sample objects.
- To view Project Folder details, click on the Project Folder within the left-hand navigation -- or alternatively, click on the Project Folder in the main window.  The toolbar functions (Summary, Edit, History, Manage) will allow you to manage folder details; you can also copy and paste objects between folders.  These functions will be covered in further detail in future releases.
12. Once you've finished exploring the Nuxeo DAMS, please ensure that you log out.
