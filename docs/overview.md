##Data storage
Data for all collections designated for public access—whether managed in the shared DAMS or in other platforms—is harvested by CDL and stored in the UCLDC common index. “Data” includes item-level metadata and references to access copies of files, stored by CDL for the optimal display of content in public access points (described below).

##Exposure to public access points
CDL exposes all of the data in the common index to three public access points:

•	The common index API, which can be used to query and display the data in custom interfaces
•	The new Calisphere website (beta version to be released in Summer 2015)
•	The Digital Public Library of America (DPLA) website and platform
