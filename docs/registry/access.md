Currently, all of the data harvested into and stored in the UCLDC Common Index is exposed to three public access points. As development continues on this part of the platform, we will be adding more information to this site.

##Calisphere
The Calisphere BETA website is expected to launch in late August 2015, with an earlier soft launch in late June/early July.

We are currently working on metadata display specifications, as well as developing the site proper. In the meantime, please feel free to [review the Calisphere BETA designs](https://wiki.library.ucsf.edu/display/UCLDC/Calisphere+Design+Showroom). (Content owners may want to pay particular attention to the display of various digital object types.)

##DPLA
Please visit the [DPLA project wiki](https://wiki.library.ucsf.edu/display/DPLA/Calisphere%3A+Broadening+Access+through+DPLA) for more information about this part of the platform. (Information from the wiki will be ported over to this site shortly.)

##UCLDC Common Index API
The UCLDC Common Index API is under development, along with the index itself. Developers may wish to [explore the API]({{ site.url }}{{ basesite.url }}//docs/technical-docs/solr-api/), with the understanding that it will change in the next several weeks.

<!--Once harvested, how do I get to our metadata records in the Common Index?
You can access the metadata through the API.  For more information...


How do I get to our metadata records hosted by DPLA?
You can access the metadata through DPLA's API or bulk download option.


How will we be able to get usage statistics for our collections that are accessible through Calisphere?
Yes; with the Calisphere BETA launch in 2015, we will be able to track and provide usage statistics for your collections.  The particular web analytics technology that we will use is to be determined.-->
