Depositing objects from the DAMS to Merritt can be initiated on request.  Your Collection Administrator can initiate the request.  In order to be deposited into Merritt, we will need the following pieces of information:

<p>1. The source Project Folder(s) in Nuxeo, containing the objects to be deposited.</p>

<p>2. The target Collection(s) in Merritt, where the objects should be deposited.</p>  

Note that once objects are deposited from Nuxeo into Merritt, the pass-through storage costs associated with Merritt will be applied.  For more information about Merritt storage costs, contact <a href="mailto:uc3@ucop.edu">uc3@ucop.edu</a>.
