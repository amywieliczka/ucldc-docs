The UC Libraries Digital Collection (UCLDC) is a technical platform for managing, aggregating, and sharing digital collections from libraries, archives, and museums at all ten UC campuses and across California. This site contains policies and procedures for content providers. Use the links at right and the guides above to navigate to topics of interest.

Overview
==============================================================================

The UCLDC platform comprises two major components:

Harvest and dissemination
-----------------------------------
The UCLDC platform aggregates disparate digital collections across the State of California, by way of an item-level metadata harvest from host websites and repositories into a Common Index. It then exposes the data stored in the Common Index to three public access points: 

- The Calisphere BETA website (coming August 2015)
- The [Digital Public Library of America](http://dp.la) website and platform
- The [common index API]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/docs/technical-docs/index/), which can be used to query and display the data in custom interfaces.

Content providers can work with CDL to provide data feeds for harvest from their own systems; UC Libraries may additionally elect to use the shared DAMS described below. Policies and procedures to queue your collections for harvest are in the [Calisphere Administration Guide]({{ site.url }}{{site.baseurl}}/docs/registry/index/).

Shared digital asset management system (DAMS)
-----------------------------------------------------
At this time, the Shared DAMS is available for use only for libraries within the University of California system.

The Nuxeo DAMS is a tool for object-level metadata and associated content file management. Use the DAMS to build simple and complex objects - including images, texts, audio, video, etc. - import or create metadata records, and import or upload content files. Read the [DAMS User Guide]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/docs/dams/index/) for more information about managing content in the DAMS.
