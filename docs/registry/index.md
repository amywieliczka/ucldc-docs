## Using the Digital Collection Registry
The Registry is an interface for campus library staff to manage and apply standardized information about campus units and digital collections that are published in Calisphere, and also to define and initiate metadata harvests for those collections. "Collections" may be defined in a few different ways. They may reside in the shared DAMS that is part of the UCLDC or they may be harvested from external sources (such as a campus OAI feed, the Internet Archive, or OAC/Calisphere) and brought into the UCLDC's central index.

The collection registry is an essential part of the UCLDC system with a few different use cases. Specifically, it handles the following functions:

- Serve as an "authority" file for collection and campus unit information
- Provide campuses witha  "self-service" dashboard for initiating metadata harvesting for collections
- Drive some essential display requirements for the UCLDC public interface. For example, public interface end-users will be able to facet search results by campus unit.
- Enable campuses to denote and track the status of digital collections, for example indicating the location of collections ready for harvest.
- Provide a platform for collaborative digital collection development and/or digitization planning
