Key Role: Collection Administrator

In order to simplify procedures and ensure coordination between local and systemwide processes, each data provider has a designated UCLDC Collection Administrator who will be primarily responsible for initiating and managing harvests, and communicating any key information to the CDL. Collection Administrators may be assigned at the campus or institution level, by each campus. Read more.

- Collection Administrator contacts the CDL to determine which collection(s) should be harvested.  “Collections” may be defined in a few different ways. They may reside in the shared DAMS that is part of the UCLDC or they may be harvested from external sources (such as a campus' DAMS, a campus website, OAC/Calisphere, or other source) and brought into the UCLDC’s central index.

- The CDL works with the Collection Administrator to establish the collection in the Collection Registry.  This includes basic information about the collection that will be used within the UCLDC public interface (e.g., title, description), as well as key information such as the method for harvesting the metadata.

My campus has collections in the Shared DAMS.  How will we be able to harvest that metadata into the Common Index, so the objects can be published in Calisphere BETA in August 2015?

We will be implementing a workflow whereby Campus Administrators will be able to specify and indicate which collections in the Shared DAMS are ready for publication, for subsequent harvesting.  The exact process will be developed and implemented prior to August 2015.

<div class="note"><p>I think since the Registry is really limited right now to viewing collections, it could simply be a call out at this point to let people know it's coming and we'll eventually move in this more self-serve direction</p></div>
