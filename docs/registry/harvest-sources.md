##Sources of data
We can harvest metadata from a range of sources, and will work with content owners to define metadata mappings and the harvesting approach. There are currently four general sources of metadata from which we are harvesting:

- UC campus DAMS/repository systems
- Other institution-managed platforms and websites with digital content
- The UCLDC Shared DAMS
- The Online Archive of California METS repository

At this time, the only technical requirement for a data source managed by a campus or institution is that it hosts or "resolves" the digital content somehow on a public interface (i.e. provides display and/or download for images and texts and playback for A/V resources).
