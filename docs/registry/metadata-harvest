All data harvested into the common index must adhere to the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1u2RE9PD0N9GkLQTFNJy3HiH9N5IbKDG52HjJ6JomC9I/edit#gid=265758929">UCLDC Metadata Harvesting Scheme and Crosswalk</a>, which was adapted from the DPLA Metadata Application Profile.The following table summarizes data elements that should be present in each metadata record. Note that default values for <b>Type</b>, <b>Rights (Status)</b>, and <b>Rights (Statement)</b> can optionally be supplied and applied to individual metadata records at the time they are harvested, using the Registry:
