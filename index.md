The UCLDC project is a shared system of three tools for managing and providing access to unique digital content from the ten UC campus libraries:

Nuxeo Digital Asset Management System (DAMS)
==============================================================================

A tool for object-level metadata and associated content file management. Use the DAMS to build simple to complex objects -- images, texts, audio, video, etc. -- import or create metadata records, import or upload content files. Get started by [creating an account]({{ site.url }}{{site.baseurl}}/docs/create-account/).

<p style="text-align: center"><a href="https://nuxeo.cdlib.org/nuxeo/">Nuxeo DAMS</a> - <a href="{{ site.url }}{{site.baseurl}}/docs/dams/index/">Documentation</a></p>

Collection Registry
===================

A tool for collection-level metadata management. Input the details of your archival and curated collections - regardless of whether or not their content is in the UCLDC DAMS, in another system, or simply in the planning stages of digitization. Use the Collection Registry to plan digitization projects and provide a harvest URL for a collection's objects to be made available to Calisphere. Get started by [creating an account]({{ site.url }}{{site.baseurl}}/docs/create-account/).

Calisphere
================

A publicly accessible interface for collection and object discovery. Currently in the wireframe phase of the design process.
