The Clipboard and Worklist, located at the bottom of the sidebar, are two temporary spaces where you can place objects you are currently working on or moving around in the project folder hierarchy. 

## The Clipboard

In order to copy or move objects between different project folders, you'll use the Clipboard to gather up and temporarily store one or more objects, before navigating to the destination project folder to move or paste your objects in place. 

<div class="walkthrough new">Bear Walkthrough</div>

1. Navigate to your sample project folder within your campus folder. (Described in [Organizing Objects with Project Folders]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/docs/dams/organization/).)
2. Create a second project folder inside your sample project folder. Call this project folder your name followed by "-Bear Collection"
3. Go back to your sample project folder. If you did the [Bulk Edit]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/docs/dams/bulk-edit/) walkthrough, you'll already have several objects in your sample folder titled "Golden Bear". If not, create three simple objects with the title "Golden Bear" and the alternative title "Bear Objects" and navigate back to your sample project folder. 
4. Select two of the Golden Bear objects in your sample project folder's content listing (See Some Notes on Selecting Objects and Pagination in
[Bulk Edit]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/docs/dams/bulk-edit/) for more information about selecting objects in content listings.), leaving one "Golden Bear" object unselected. 
5. Press the 'Copy' button below the content listing.

<div class="note"><p>In most software, there is 'cut' and 'copy'. In Nuxeo, you always 'copy' an object(s) to the clipboard, and then from the clipboard you either 'move' (no duplication) or 'paste' (duplication) an object into it's destination.</p></div>

<ol start="6">
  <li>If the Clipboard is not shown in the sidebar, select the 'Clipboard' tab, next to the 'Worklist' tab, in the panel below the hierarchy sidebar panel. The two Golden Bear objects should appear in the Clipboard, and also should still appear in your sample project folder.</li>
  <li>Navigate to your Bear Collection folder.</li>
  <li>In the Clipboard panel in the sidebar, click the link 'Move in current folder'. You should immediately see a notification in the top right corner reading 'Two document(s) moved.'</li> 
</ol>

<div class="note"><p>Be sure to use the 'Move in current folder' link to move objects from the clipboard to the current folder. You can use the 'Paste in current folder' link below the 'Move in current folder' link, or the Paste button next to the Copy button below the content listing, but pasting an object <b>will</b> duplicate it. There is no easy way to merge two duplicated items, so it's best to avoid duplicating objects unless absolutely necessary.</p></div>

<ol start="9">
  <li>Now in your Bear Collection folder, you should see two Golden Bear objects.</li>
  <li>Navigate back to your sample project folder. There, you should see only one Golden Bear object.</li>
</ol>

## The Worklist

The Worklist is like a temporary, personalized project folder. If you are, for example, working on entering metadata for a set of objects in different project folders, you can find all of the objects, and temporarily place them in the Worklist. 

<div class="walkthrough new">Bear Walkthrough</div>

This walkthrough is meant to accompany the above clipboard walkthrough and assumes you have a sample project folder containing a second project folder called "Bear Collection" and one object with the title "Golden Bear" and the alternative title "Bear Objects". Within your Bear Collection project folder, you should have two objects, each with the title "Golden Bear" and the alternative title "Bear Objects".

1. Navigate to your sample project folder within your campus folder. 
2. Select the one Golden Bear object within your campus folder. 
3. Click the 'Add to worklist' button below the content listing. 
4. If the Worklist is not shown in the sidebar, select the 'Worklist' tab, next to the 'Clipboard' tab, in the panel below the hierarchy sidebar panel. The Golden Bear object you just selected should be listed there. 
5. Navigate into your Bear Collection project folder. 
6. Select only one of the two objects in the Bear Collection folder and click the 'Add to worklist' button. 
7. Now you should have two Golden Bear objects in the Worklist. 
8. Click on the first Golden Bear object. At the top of the object page, your breadcrumbs should read: Asset Library > Your Campus > Your Sample Folder > Golden Bear. 
9. Scroll down to the metadata and select edit. 
10. Add the alternative title "UC Berkeley Bear". Scroll down and press the 'Save' button. 
11. Now click on the second Golden Bear object in the Worklist. The breadcrumbs should read: Asset Library > Your Campus > Your Sample Folder > Your Bear Collection > Golden Bear. 
12. Add the alternative title "UC Berkeley". Scroll down and press the 'Save' button. 

<div class="note"><p>You can also move and paste the contents of the Worklist into the current folder by clicking the 'Move in current folder' and 'Paste in current folder' links in the Worklist.</p></div>
