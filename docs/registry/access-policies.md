##Collection Development
(coming soon)

##Metadata rights and restrictions
Because currently all data in the UCLDC common index will be shared with DPLA, all data must comply with DPLAâ€™s Policy Statement on Metadata: http://dp.la/info/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/DPLAMetadataPolicy.pdf. 

In brief, for all data in the UCLDC index:

- The vast majority of metadata is not subject to copyright restrictions.
- Creators of metadata agree to dedicate any copyrightable metadata to the public domain pursuant to a CC0 Public Domain Dedication.
- CDL asserts no rights over the metadata in the UCLDC common index and dedicates its contributions to the public domain.
- Users are free to harvest, collect, modify, and/or otherwise use any metadata contained in the UCLDC common index (by way of the DPLA website and platform, the UCLDC API, and/or Calisphere). Note that although the CC0 dedication gives users the right to use the data in the common index for any purpose and without restriction, CDL nevertheless encourages users to adopt the best practices at...[TBD]

The stated rights and restrictions comply with the proposed UC Libraries Metadata Sharing Policy.

##Metadata guidelines
Currently, all data harvested into the UCLDC common index must adhere to the metadata scheme available at [TBD], which was adapted from the DPLA Metadata Application Profile (http://dp.la/info/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/DPLA-MAP-V3.1-2.pdf). This ensures the interoperability and display of data on the DPLA site, the Calisphere site, and any sites developed using the UCLDC API. CDL will work with collection owners to create any necessary metadata mappings from local systems, as well as potentially enhance metadata by reconciling it with third-party sources.

CDL and the UC Libraries may determine in the future to create more restrictive requirements, should they substantially improve the user experience across the aggregation (for example, by enabling new facets).
