##Role of Collection Administrator
In order to simplify procedures and ensure coordination between local and systemwide processes, each data provider has designated a [UCLDC Collection Administrator.]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/docs/collection-admins/) who will be primarily responsible for initiating and managing harvests and communicating any key information to the CDL. Collection Administrators are assigned by the campus and/or institution.

Once you have identified a collection(s) to be harvested by the UCLDC platform, please contact your [Collection Administrator.]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/docs/collection-admins/)

##Process
1. The Collection Administrator works with others on campus/at the institution to determine that a collection(s) of digital objects is ready for harvest and public access through the UCLDC platform, according to any local processes developed for decision-making.

2. The Collection Administrator notifies the CDL about which collection(s) should be harvested, and out of which platform. (<i>Please note that this includes collections which are hosted in the UCLDC Shared DAMS.</i>) At this time, we request simply that the Collection Administrator [send us an email notification](mailto:ucldc@ucop.edu).

3. The CDL works with the Collection Administrator to establish the collection in the [Collection Registry](http://registry.cdlib.org). This includes basic information about the collection that will be used within the UCLDC public interface (e.g., title, description), as well as key information such as the method for harvesting the metadata.

<div class="note"><p>The Collection Registry is an interface for content owners to define harvest targets for digital collections and to apply standardized information about campuses, institutions, and collections. Eventually, it may also support digital collection development and staging processes.</p></div>

##Avoiding redundant harvest
We are aware that some collections reside on multiple platforms. Most commonly, many collections reside in both the OAC/Calisphere METS repository (from which we are harvesting into the UCLDC platform) as well either the UCLDC Shared DAMS or a locally-managed solution.

It is up to campuses and institutions to determine which version of the collection you want to harvest into the platform. We can simply re-direct the harvest of a given collection to a different target (e.g. a campus DAMS). Once the appropriate target has been determined for a given collection, the Collection Administrator can contact us and indicate the new source and URL for harvesting. We will then work with the Administrator to harvest the collection from the preferred source.
