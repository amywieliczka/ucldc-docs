##Criteria for inclusion

At this time, the shared digital asset management system (DAMS) is open only to digital resources owned and/or stewarded by the UC Libraries. Otherwise, there are no criteria for inclusion.

From a technical perspective, the Nuxeo platform may be better suited to some digital resources (for example, certain file types and formats) than others. See [Supported File Formats](http://doc.nuxeo.com/display/NXDOC/Supported+File+Formats) for the current version of Nuxeo supported by the CDL. CDL encourages campus partners to [contact us](ucldc@ucop.edu) about new resource types they are considering describing, storing, and/or managing using the shared DAMS.

##Metadata guidelines

The metadata scheme for the UCLDC Shared DAMS is available in the [DAMS user guide](../dams/metadata-model/).

Metadata is not required for adding and managing resources in the DAMS, to allow content owners to safely and persistently store digital content with access restrictions and at all levels of "readiness." However, note that some metadata is required for providing public access to those resources, i.e. sending them for harvest into the UCLDC Common Index for dissemination. Please refer to the [UCLDC Metadata Harvesting Scheme](http://ucldc.github.io/ucldc-docs/docs/registry/metadata-harvest/) for these requirements.)

##Access to the DAMS

Only authorized users—UC Libraries staff, student workers, and other individuals expressly designated by the UC Libraries—may access the shared DAMS. An account is necessary for accessing the system; once an account is obtained, a user can authenticate with his/her single sign-on credentials via Shibboleth. The creation of accounts are authorized by UCLDC Collection Administrators ([learn more](../create-account)).

By default, all folders in the shared DAMS and the digital resources and metadata within them are “read only,” meaning any DAMS user can view but not edit all content in the system. UCLDC Collection Administrators can manually restrict the viewing and editing of particular folders and items, as necessary.
