We are using Google Analytics for tracking usage of objects on the new Calisphere beta site.

###What's supported
We are able to support contributor statistics in the following way:

-Separate Google Analytics reports for separate institutions. (Campuses can elect to "roll-up" institutions into a single report if so desired; see below.) Data is collected on each institution's digital objects, collection landing pages, and institution landing pages.
-Filtering by collection, within a given report.

###What we need from you
In order to collect usage statistics for your institution, we need the following information, as provided by a UCLDC Collection Administrator or other designated staff member:

**1. Google Analytics tracker ID**

A Google Analytics tracker ID is generated when you open a new Google Analytics Account or Property. It will result in a separate report for usage of your collections on Calisphere BETA. If you would like some assistance in setting up a Google Analytics Account or Property, please don't hesitate to contact us.

**2. Assignment of tracker IDs to institutions**

We need to know to what institution(s) the tracker ID should be applied. Campuses with more than one contributing institution to Calisphere BETA (defined as a "unit" in the UCLDC Collection Registry) can elect to apply different tracker IDs to different institutions (resulting in a separate report for each institution) or apply the same tracker ID to multiple institutions (resulting in a single Google Analytics report for those institutions).

Simply let us know which tracker ID should be applied to which institutions on your campus.

**3. Preferred collection label**

Each Google Analytics report for Calisphere BETA will allow contributors to filter by collection. This means that you can see the usage stats for a given collection as defined on Calisphere BETA.

We've heard that some institutions want to specify how collections are labelled within the Google Analytics report, for example by Name or Collection Number. If you have a particular way you want your collections to appear in the report, let us know. For collections that have corresponding finding aids on the OAC, by default the value in this field will be the Collection Number.

###What's being counted
CDL does not plan to engineer any custom events for content ownersâ€™ usage reports, unless this is surfaced as a need. This means that the typical (but extensive!) suite of usage data from Google Analytics will be reported in the areas of Audience, Acquisition, and Behavior. Please let us know if you have additional requirements and we will try to accommodate them.
