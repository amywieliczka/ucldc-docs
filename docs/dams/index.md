The Nuxeo Digital Asset Management System (DAMS) is a tool for object-level metadata management. Upload and store content files and their affiliated metadata records in the DAMS. If you have an account already, use your Single Sign-On account to login at [https://nuxeo.cdlib.org/nuxeo/](https://nuxeo.cdlib.org/nuxeo/). If you do not already have an account, please [create an account]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/docs/create-account/).

On login, you should see a screen that looks like this:

label 'navigation bar' (home, document management, admin center, studio, username, quick search, advanced search), 'tabs' (content, history, manage), 'sidebar', and 'sidebar modes' (hierarchy, search, tags, places?, categories?)!

The DAMS are hierarchically organized. We are at the root of the hierarchy, looking at a list of its contents. From here, click on 'Asset Library' to navigate into the DAMS' assets. Now you should see a list of all 10 campuses and UCOP. Navigate to your campus' folder to see a list of project folders. Notice how the sidebar reflects where you are in the hierarchy. Feel free to explore the Content, History, and Manage tabs on the Asset Library, your campus' folder, and other campuses' folders.
