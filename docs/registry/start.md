##Role of Collection Administrator
In order to simplify procedures and ensure coordination between local and systemwide processes, each data provider has designated a UCLDC Collection Administrator who will be primarily responsible for initiating and managing harvests and communicating any key information to the CDL. Collection Administrators are assigned by the campus and/or institution. Read more.

Once you have identified a collection(s) to be harvested by the UCLDC platform, please contact your Collection Administrator.

##Process
1. The Collection Administrator works with others on campus/at the institution to determine that a collection(s) is ready for harvest and public access through the UCLDC platform, according to any local processes developed for decision-making.

2. The Collection notifies the CDL about which collection(s) should be harvested, and out of which platform. (<i>Please note that this includes collections which are hosted in the UCLDC Shared DAMS.</i>) At this time, we request simply that the Collection Administrator [send us an email notification](mailto:ucldc@ucop.edu).

3. The CDL works with the Collection Administrator to establish the collection in the [Collection Registry](http://registry.cdlib.org). This includes basic information about the collection that will be used within the UCLDC public interface (e.g., title, description), as well as key information such as the method for harvesting the metadata.

<div class="note"><p>The Collection Registry is an interface for content owners to manage and apply standardized information about campuses, institutions, and digital collections, and to define and initiate metadata harvests for those collections. In the future, we plan for these functions to become increasingly self-serve and automated; for the time being, however, we can work with you to edit information in the registry.</p></div>

##Selecting a harvest target
We are aware that in several cases, collections reside on multiple platforms.

We already have some digital collections in the legacy OAC/Calisphere METS repository, and those collections are also available in our campus' DAMS.  Will you harvest the metadata for those collections from both locations?  What if we want to feature the version of the collection in our campus DAMS?

Collection Administrators can specify which collection should be privileged for harvesting.  We will then harvest the collection from the preferred source.

Similar to the previous question, Collection Administrators can specify which collection should be privileged for harvesting.  We will then harvest the collection from the preferred source.
