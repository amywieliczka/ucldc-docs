##Adrian's notes

- The CDL works with the Collection Administrator to confirm how the source metadata should be mapped into the Common Index.
- The CDL runs an initial harvest and reviews the results with the Collection Administrator into a testing instance of the Common Index.  The metadata can then be previewed in a testing instance of Calisphere.  If necessary, adjustments are made to the metadata mappings and additional test harvests are initiated.
- Once the results are approved by the Collection Administrator, the CDL will harvest the metadata into a production instance of the Common Index. All harvested that is approved for publication will be accessible through the Calisphere BETA website and subsequently through DPLA in August 2015.   

How is the harvested metadata being mapped through to the Common Index?  

Metadata from harvested sources is mapped to a set of standardized data elements, based on the DPLA Metadata Application Profile.  The mappings are defined in the Metadata Harvesting Scheme and Crosswalk. 


What kind of metadata is required for harvesting?

All data harvested into the common index must adhere to the UCLDC Metadata Harvesting Scheme and Crosswalk, which was adapted from the DPLA Metadata Application Profile.  A small number of data elements must be present in each metadata record that is harvested.  For more information....
