UCLDC Collection Administrators perform administrative functions in the DAMS and Collection Registry on behalf of—and in close consultation with—their respective institutions. Specific responsibilities include:

- Authorizing users of the shared DAMS affiliated with their respective campus libraries
- Setting the appropriate permissions for shared DAMS users, using the Nuxeo interface
- Restricting access to their campuses’ resources in the shared DAMS (as necessary), using the Nuxeo interface
- Indicating which resources (if any) in the shared DAMS should be sent to Merritt for long-term preservation
- Authorizing editors of the Collection Registry (for adding and editing institution and collection data and harvest URLs)
- Indicating when their institutions’ collections are ready for harvest into the UCLDC common index
- Serving as first points of contact for CDL on issues and questions related to their respective institutions’ collections
