##Process
Once the source and target URL are established for a collection, CDL will work with institutions to ensure that required metadata is present, that it is mapped correctly, and that it appears in Calisphere correctly. Steps in this stage include the following: 

- CDL works with the Collection Administrator and/or other appropriate staff to confirm how the source metadata should be mapped into the Common Index.
- CDL runs an initial harvest and reviews, with staff, the results in a testing instance of the UCLDC Common Index.  The metadata can then be previewed in a testing instance of Calisphere. If necessary, adjustments are made to the metadata mappings and additional test harvests are initiated.
- Once the results are approved by the Collection Administrator, CDL harvests the metadata into a production instance of the UCLDC Common Index. All harvested collections that are approved for publication will be accessible through the Calisphere BETA website and DPLA.

##Metadata mapping and requirements

Metadata from harvested sources is mapped to a set of standardized data elements, which have been based on the DPLA Metadata Application Profile. A small number of data elements must be present in each record that is harvested. These mappings and requirements are defined in the [Metadata Harvesting Scheme and Crosswalk]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/docs/registry/metadata-harvest/).
