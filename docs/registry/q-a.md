Once the source and target URL are established for a collection, CDL will work with institutions to ensure that required metadata is present, that it is mapped correctly, and that it appears in Calisphere correctly. Steps in this stage include the following: 

- CDL works with the Collection Administrator and/or other appropriate staff to confirm how the source metadata should be mapped into the Common Index, using the [Metadata Harvesting Scheme and Crosswalk]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/docs/registry/metadata-harvest/). 
- The following metadata is required for all objects: <b>Type</b>, <b>Rights (Status)</b>, and <b>Rights (Statement)</b>. If this information is not available in the source metadata, the Collection Administrator may opt to supply metadata which CDL can globally apply to all objects in the collection.
- CDL runs an initial harvest and reviews, with campus/institution staff, the results in a testing instance of the UCLDC Common Index.  Staff then preview the metadata in a testing instance of Calisphere. If necessary, adjustments are made to the metadata mappings and additional test harvests are initiated.
- Once the results are approved by the Collection Administrator, CDL harvests the metadata into a production instance of the UCLDC Common Index. All harvested collections that are approved for publication will be accessible through the Calisphere BETA website, DPLA, and the UCLDC Common Index API.
