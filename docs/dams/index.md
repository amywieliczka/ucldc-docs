The Nuxeo DAMS is a tool for object-level metadata and associated content file management. Use the DAMS to build simple to complex objects -- images, texts, audio, video, etc. -- import or create metadata records, and import or upload content files. If you have an account already, use your Single Sign-On account to login at [https://nuxeo.cdlib.org/nuxeo/](https://nuxeo.cdlib.org/nuxeo/). If you do not already have an account, please [create an account]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/docs/create-account/).

On login, you should see a screen that looks like this: 

<a class="img-popup" href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/1_on-login.png">
  <img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/1_on-login.png" alt="Screenshot after logging in" style="width: 500px">
</a>

The DAMS are hierarchically organized. We are at the root of the hierarchy, looking at a list of its contents. From here, click on 'Asset Library' to navigate into specific [project folders]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/docs/dams/organization/). Now you should see a list of all 10 campuses and UCOP. Navigate to the project folder for your particular campus. You will then see a list of project folders named for individual collections that we have loaded into the DAMS. Notice how the sidebar reflects where you are in the hierarchy. Feel free to explore the your campus's project folders -- and other campuses' folders. 

### Key Elements to the DAMS interface:

- Navigation Bar
  - Home: use this to return to the default landing page for the DAMS.
  - Document Management: this is the primary, functional area of the DAMS for creating and managing digital objects.
  - Username: Click here to logout.
  - Quick & Advanced Search: See the [search]() section for further details. 
- Sidebar
  - Digital objects within the DAMS are hierarchically organized. By default, the sidebar displays this hierarchy.
- Breadcrumbs: Used to reveal where the object or folder you are currently viewing exists in the hierarchy.
- Current object or project folder & its tabs: These tabs change depending on the kind of object or folder you are viewing and will be discussed in subsequent sections for [project folders]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/docs/dams/organization/) and [objects]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/docs/dams/edit-objects/).
