<span style="color: red">At this time, accounts are limited to UCLDC Implementation Project collaborators (members of SAG2 and the UCLDC Product Stakeholder Group and their designees). Members of these groups can request UCLDC accounts using the following steps:</span>

1. Start at the Collection Registry administration URL: [https://registry.cdlib.org/edit/](https://registry.cdlib.org/edit/). Request an account by logging in using your Single Sign-On account.

2. You will receive a confirmation message indicating that your account request has been submitted. The request will be processed by the UCLDC Project Implementation team.

3. A UCLDC Project Implementation team member will send a follow-up e-mail to you, to confirm once your account has been activated. At that point, you can log into the Nuxeo DAMS <span style="color: red">(as described further below) -- and in subsequent releases, you will be able to log into the Collection Registry to manage collection details.</span>
