All data harvested into the Common Index must adhere to the [UCLDC Metadata Harvesting Scheme and Crosswalk](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1u2RE9PD0N9GkLQTFNJy3HiH9N5IbKDG52HjJ6JomC9I/edit#gid=265758929), which was adapted from the DPLA Metadata Application Profile.

##Required Metadata
***
<p>The following table summarizes data elements that must be present in each metadata record for harvest into the Common Index. Note that default values for <b>Type</b>, <b>Rights (Status)</b>, and <b>Rights (Statement)</b> can optionally be supplied and applied to individual metadata records at the time they are harvested, using the Collection Registry:</p>

* <a class="label">Title</a>
* <a class="label">Type</a>
* <a class="label">Rights (Status)</a>
* <a class="label">Rights (Statement)</a>
* <a class="label">Is Shown At (URL to object view)</a>
* <a class="label">Object (URL to object view)</a>
