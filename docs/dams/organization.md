## Project Folders

Projects folders are for your own internal organizational and access restriction needs. They can be used to encapsulate objects, complex objects, and other project folders, and you can grant read and write privileges to project folders as needed. 

From within your campus' folder, you can create as many project folders (and nested project folders) as you need. In order to create new project folders, navigate to your campus' folder, and press the 'New' button. 

<div class="note">You'll notice if you navigate to another campus' folder, the 'New' button won't be present. That is because you have read-only access to other campus' folders.</div>

For collections we have loaded into the DAMS, each object in a collection is encapsulated in a project folder of the same name as the collection. You could also use project folders to define a particular workspace for a group of users with limited access rights, for organizing digitization projects or chunks of a collection that have been digitized, for organizing by completeness of metadata records in the DAMS or method of digitization, for organizing chunks of a collection for a specific project or staff member, etc. 

<div class="note">A folder does not necessarily have to encapsulate a collection. The Nuxeo DAMS are used for object-level metadata entry, so what <i>really</i> matters in publishing a collection to Calisphere, or preserving a collection in Merritt, is that the 'Collection/Unit' field and access restriction fields in an object's metadata record are filled out accurately.</div>

To create a new project folder 

1. Navigate to your campus' folder
2. Click on the 'Content' tab if it is not already selected by default, and press 'New'.
3. There is only one available document type for children of a campus' folder - a project folder. Click 'Project Folder'. 
4. For the required 'Title' field, input "Banana Slug".
5. For the optional 'Description' field, input "A trial project folder for testing the features of the Banana Slug release." 
6. Then press 'Create'. 

<p>You should then be directed to that project folder's page, with the 'Content' tab selected. In the hierarchy sidebar, you should see 'Banana Slug' underneath your campus' folder.</p>
