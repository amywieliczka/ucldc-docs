###Criteria for inclusion
---
At this time, the shared digital asset management system (DAMS) is open only to digital resources owned and/or stewarded by the UC Libraries. Otherwise, there are no criteria for inclusion.

From a technical perspective, the Nuxeo platform may be better suited to some digital resources (for example, certain file types and formats) than others. A list of formats supported by the current version of Nuxeo is available at http://doc.nuxeo.com/display/NXDOC/Supported+File+Formats. CDL encourages campus partners to contact us at ucldc@ucop.edu about new resource types they are considering describing, storing, and/or managing using the shared DAMS.

###Metadata guidelines
---
The metadata scheme for the shared DAMS is available in the [DAMS user guide](../dams/metadata-model/).

Metadata is not required for adding and managing resources in the DAMS. (Note that some metadata is required for providing public access to those resources, as discussed below.)

###Access to the DAMS
---
Only authorized users—UC Libraries staff, student workers, and other individuals expressly designated by the UC Libraries—may access the shared DAMS. To do so, they must [obtain an account](../create-account) from CDL. They can then authenticate with their single sign-on credentials through Shibboleth.

By default, all folders in the shared DAMS and the digital resources and metadata within them are “read only,” meaning any DAMS user can view but not edit all content in the system. UCLDC Collection Administrators can manually restrict the viewing and editing of particular folders and items, as necessary.
